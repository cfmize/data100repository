 Sen’s view on development focuses on whether individuals can exercise their capabilities, freedoms, and choices rather than increases in average incomes. Barder explains that 
judging development by its effects  on people doesn’t mean it is the sum of the well-being of people or output of firms, but a property of the economic and social system itself.

The toaster project was an effort by Thomas Thwaite to recreate the simplest toaster he could find starting with just raw materials. He had to be pretty innovative in how he created some of the parts. For example, he had to smelt down steel for much of the toaster, so he smelted it down in a microwave. Thwaite said that the project was a partial success, he managed to create a functioning toaster, however he did not have rubber to insulate the wires, so after five seconds it burst into flames. It took him nine months and several months to get all the parts assembled and create the toaster. This example shows that even building the simplest toaster he could find required an array of different technologies and parts. The economy has to be sufficiently rich and sophisticated to supply these technologies and parts. Additionally, if you were going to make a business out of making toasters that would require electricity, transport, labor, a capital supply, and a legal system to enforce contracts. Development is not an increase in output by an individual firm but an emergence of a system of economic, financial, legal, social, and political systems. These systems provide for technologies, firms, and products which allow citizens to live happy and fulfilling lives.

Barder explains that there has been no explanation for the difference in which nations manage to progress at rates that have never been seen in history while others continue to stagnate. Some models look for missing ingredients to find the solution. These include capital, technology, better institutions, and better politics. Also, every time something missing has been identified, it cannot be provided from outside but rather an endogenous characteristic of the system.

Steve Jones is an evolutionary biologist who started his career at Unilever. He was hired to improve the design of spray nozzles in manufacturing soap. Rather than designing the nozzle himself, which was very difficult, he made ten copies, randomly distorted them and tested which worked best. He then took ten copies of that nozzle, randomly distorted it and took the best nozzle again. He did this for 45 generations creating a nozzle which was 100’s of times more efficient than the original.

Complex adaptive systems is a dynamic network of interactions whose behavior cannot be predicted based on the behavior of its components. One feature is that they are difficult or impossible to predict in detail. Second, you can make broad predictions about the system as a whole. Third, they have emergent properties. There are patterns in the system that are not linked to any individual part. Fourth, complex adaptive systems tend toward greater complexity. There are billions of products being sold in one city alone. Fifth, these systems do not tend towards an equilibrium. Generally, the global patterns are relatively stable for long periods of time before rapidly making large changes.

Haile Sellasie was the last emperor of Ethiopia as the feudal system was overthrown in 1974. Any decisions came from the emperor and people were scared to tell him about the poverty and starvation. The rich and powerful of the country benefited from the existing economic structure, so they saw no need to change it and saw anyone who did as a threat. This suppressed the emergence of more plural and equal economic and social institutions.

Barder recommends resisting engineering since evolutionary processes often outperform design such as in the Steve Jones example. Also, the nonlinear dynamics of the system as a whole makes it difficult to predict what will happen as a result of a change, making engineering almost impossible. Isomorphic mimicry is when institutions are created as a result of donors offering money, however these institutions have no drive for performance but are solely there to look like they are capable.

Barder describes resisting fatalism as accelerating and shaping evolution. Norman Borlaug did this by intervening in the evolutionary process to develop high yield, disease resistance wheat varieties. This started the green revolution which is estimated to have saved a billion people around the globe.
