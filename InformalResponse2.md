“Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement.”
Sinan Aral (cited in Kitchen, 2014) 

In “Big Data, New Epistemologies and Paradigm Shifts” by Rob Kitchen the author emphasizes the importance of measurement as a significant contributing factor for improved 
description and analysis of complex natural and/or social phenomenon. How is the advent of big data serving to advance this revolution in measurement and subsequently, how is 
this revolution in measurement serving to elevate data science as an interdisciplinary field of study? How is the data deluge advancing a better understanding of human movement, 
behavior and relationships? How does data science contribute towards our improved understanding of human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system?

Big data is an advancement in measurement as scientists have never before been able to analyze petabytes of data. The traditional way to conduct an experiment consisted of a 
hypothesis which would then be tested using data of a sample meant to represent an entire population. Big data can be used to find correlations in an entire dataset without the 
use of a model or hypothesis, so the scientist may not have known they were even there.
