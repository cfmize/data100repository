“Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement.”
Sinan Aral (cited in Kitchen, 2014) 

In “Big Data, New Epistemologies and Paradigm Shifts” by Rob Kitchen the author emphasizes the importance of measurement as a significant contributing factor for improved 
description and analysis of complex natural and/or social phenomenon. How is the advent of big data serving to advance this revolution in measurement and subsequently, how is 
this revolution in measurement serving to elevate data science as an interdisciplinary field of study? How is the data deluge advancing a better understanding of human movement, 
behavior and relationships? How does data science contribute towards our improved understanding of human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system?

  Big data is an advancement in measurement as scientists have never before been able to analyze petabytes of data. The traditional way to conduct an experiment consisted of a 
hypothesis which would then be tested using data of a sample meant to represent an entire population. Big data can be used to find correlations in data without the 
use of a model or hypothesis, so the scientist may not have known they were even there. Some believe this is the end of theory since correlations can be found without an initial
hypothesis. However, without context and domain-specific expertise, the correlations found can be misinterpreted and misunderstood. Additionally, Big Data seeks to 
interpret the entire population of a dataset without bias, yet the data is a representation shaped by the technology used and is still subject to sampling bias.

  This doesn't mean no value can be gained from the use of Big Data. It certainly has uses which have and will greatly benefit the scientific community such as the shotgun gene
sequencing done by J. Craig Venter. He used high-speed sequencers and supercomputers, which statistically analyze the data they produced, to sequence individual organisms then
entire ecosystems. He managed to discover thousands of unkown bacteria and other life-forms. Venter knows nothing about the species other than that there is a statistical anomaly
in the data. This emphasizes the importance of collaborating with experts in the field of study. While Venter's discovery was important, it is not very useful without people to 
interpret what those species are. 

  Big Data is much harder to apply to understanding human behavior and development. While most sciences use mostly quantitative data, the humanities require a much more nuanced 
approach to its implementation. Humans are very complex and do not behave in predictable ways, so solely looking at data can lead to a reductionist viewpoint, lacking economical,
political, or historical data. This again emphasizes the importance of working with experts in the field of study to find uses which are more targeted to a certain problem.
