West studies the science of complex and emergent systems in this reading. More specifically, he looks at the universal phenomena that these systems share despite being entirely
unrelated. For example, the metabolic rates of animals scale at 3/4 the exponent, so an elephant 10,000(10^4) the size of a rat has a metabolic rate that is 1000(10^3) that of 
the rat. West has applied this principle that emergent systems scale exponentially and found themes in the data of other complex systems. 

One example of a complex system he uses is a city. These cities are made of thousands or millions of people interacting everyday as well as roads, buildings, parks, and countless
other factors. However, just like the animals, the scale of these cities can be defined quite simply. The scale of these factors when computed vs population yields approximately 
1.15. This is known as superlinear scaling as the measures increase at an increasing rate greater than one. This means that a city which is double the size of another has about 
15% more of the urban characteristics measured. These include wages, GDP, patents, and the amount of restaurants. On the other hand, the negative indicators also increase at this 
same rate, so there is more crime, pollution, and cases of AIDS and stomach flu to the same degree. Cities are formed from the energy, interaction, and communication between the 
individuals who make it up. Bigger cities have more social activity, more opportunity, higher wages, and greater access to restaurants, museums, concerts, and schools. This is 
extremely enticing for most people leading them to live there despite the increased negative aspects. Since the benefits of living in cities increase as the population increases,
for both the individual and the collective, the populations of cities has soared in recent decades.

West claims that the universality of social networks is the reason that cities scale in this way across the globe. The invention of language is the key to our evolution as a 
species and the mass urbanization that has happened recently. Through communication, humans could complete tasks faster using less energy per person. Additionally, we are able 
use our imagination to be creative and think about the future. The economies of scale that humans had discovered allowed them to progress much faster than any organism before
them. Social networks allowed for innovation and the creation of wealth. Cities attract innovative and creative individuals and allow for greater connectivity between people.
The social networks created from this connectivity lead to people conceiving and solving problems. This is a positive feedback loop of innovation and wealth creation leading to
the superlinear scaling. It is universal to all cities as all people evolved as social animals, developing social networks which were bolstered by urban environments.
