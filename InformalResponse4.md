West studies the science of complex and emergent systems in this reading. More specifically, he looks at the universal phenomena that these systems share despite being entirely
disconnected. For example, the metabolic rates of animals scale at 3/4 the exponent of their size, so an elephant 10,000(10^4) the size of a rat has a metabolic rate that is 1000(10^3) that of the rat. West has applied this principle that emergent systems scale and found themes in the data of other complex systems. 

One example of a complex system he uses is a city. These cities are made of thousands or millions of people interacting everyday as well as roads, buildings, parks, and countless
other factors. However, just like the animals, the scale of these cities can be defined quite simply. The scale of these factors when computed vs population yields approximately 
1.15. This is known as superlinear scaling as the measures increase at an increasing rate greater than one. This means that a city which is double the size of another has about 
15% more of than double urban characteristics measured. These include wages, GDP, patents, and the amount of restaurants. On the other hand, the negative indicators also increase at this same rate, so there is more crime, pollution, and cases of AIDS and stomach flu to the same degree. Cities are formed from the energy, interaction, and communication between the individuals who make it up. Bigger cities have more social activity, more opportunity, higher wages, and greater access to restaurants, museums, concerts, and schools. This is extremely enticing for most people leading them to live there despite the increased negative aspects. Since the benefits of living in cities increase as the population increases, for both the individual and the collective, the populations of cities has soared in recent decades.

West claims that the universality of social networks is the reason that cities scale in this way across the globe. The invention of language is the key to our evolution as a 
species and the mass urbanization that has happened recently. Through communication, humans could complete tasks faster using less energy per person. Additionally, we are able 
to use our imagination to be creative and think about the future. The economies of scale that humans had discovered allowed them to progress much faster than any organism before
them. Social networks allowed for innovation and the creation of wealth. Cities attract innovative and creative individuals and allow for greater connectivity between people.
The social networks created from this connectivity lead to people conceiving and solving problems. This is a positive feedback loop of innovation and wealth creation leading to
the superlinear scaling. It is universal to all cities as all people evolved as social animals, developing social networks which were bolstered by urban environments.

West cites Dunbar who found that people have small groups of close friends and family and larger, more disconnected groups that they are familiar with. Due to this organization of our relationships, the exchange of information and social interaction is greatest between individuals and decreases within larger group structures. This leads to superlinear scaling. In infrastructural networks, such as water, gas, transport, or electricity, the sizes and flows in the pipes cables and lines increase from the individual units through the network toward some central source resulting in sublinear scaling. Consequently, people and the community as a whole experience increasing returns and an accelerating pace of life when they live in cities.

West does not like the growing idea that using just data can accurately solve problems and answer questions. Some people think now that so much data can be amassed that it isn't necessary to develop models or theories when seeking to understand the world. West criticizes the use of big data without some framework for gathering and analyzing that data since correlation can be found between two data sets that are not connected. He cites the example of the variation of US spending on space, science, technology almost exactly following the variation in the number of suicides by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation between 1999 and 2010. A decrease in spending in science was not the reason for the decrease in suicides by hanging. West believes theory is necessary when using big data since a big-picture conceptual framework can be used to judge the relevance of correlations and their relationship to the causations.
